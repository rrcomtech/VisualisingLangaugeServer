/**
 * A Binding is an information about one relation between an object from the grammar and the
 * FlexDRMetaModel.
 * 
 * A Bindings can have one of three "types":
 * 		- A structural Binding
 * 				This is to be used for a structural element. It knows the name of the class
 * 				from the grammar, which shall be binded and the corresponding structural 
 * 				Meta Model type.
 * 		- A connection Binding with existing Class
 * 				This is to be used for a connection element. It knows the name of the class
 * 				from the grammar, which shall be binded and the corresponding structural
 * 				Meta Model type. Additionally, information is given which type source and
 * 				target of the connection have.
 * 		- A connection Binding without existing Class
 * 				This is to be used for a connection element, which itself is not represented
 * 				within the grammar. It knows the type of the connection. Additionally, 
 * 				information is given which type source and target of the connection have.
